## Description

A simple React application that displays an employee directory and allows users to search by name or sort the table alphabetically. User data has been pulled from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/).

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
